No external help or references are allowed.
Write the most optimized and Pythonic solution where applicable.
1. Create a dictionary representing a student with keys **, **, and ``, and assign them appropriate values.
2. Write a Python script to retrieve the value of the key `` from the following dictionary:
d = {"name": "Alice", "age": 23, "grade": "A"}

3. Add a new key-value pair to an existing dictionary where `` is added to the dictionary from question 2.
4. Write a program to check if a given key exists in a dictionary.
5. Remove the key `` from the dictionary in question 2 and print the modified dictionary.
6. Merge the following two dictionaries into a single dictionary:
dict1 = {"a": 100, "b": 200}
dict2 = {"c": 300, "d": 400}
7. Write a Python function that returns the maximum and minimum values from a dictionary of integer values.
8. Given a dictionary where keys are student names and values are lists of their marks, write a program to calculate the average marks for each student.
9. Write a program to count the occurrences of each character in a given string using a dictionary.
10. Given a dictionary where keys are product names and values are prices, write a program to find the most expensive product.
11. Create a dictionary from two lists, one containing keys and the other containing values.
12. Write a function that inverts a dictionary (i.e., swap keys and values).
13. Write a program that takes a list of dictionaries and sorts them based on a specific key in each dictionary.
14. Implement a function that takes a dictionary and returns a new dictionary with keys transformed to uppercase.
15. Given a nested dictionary, write a recursive function to flatten it into a single-level dictionary.
16. Write a Python program that finds the key with the highest corresponding value in a dictionary of numbers.
17. Create a dictionary-based cache system using Pythonâ€™s `` for a computationally expensive function.
18. Implement a function that performs a deep merge of two nested dictionaries.
19. Write a program that groups anagrams from a list of words using a dictionary.
20. Given a dictionary representing a tree structure, write a recursive function to traverse it and print all nodes.
